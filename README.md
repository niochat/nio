Nio is an upcoming [Matrix](https://matrix.org) client for iOS.

For the time being this project is still very much a work in progress. For updates, please check by in our matrix room → [#niochat:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#niochat:matrix.org).

Want to give it a spin? Join the public [TestFlight Beta](https://testflight.apple.com/join/KlXr3kKz).

### Getting Started

Since Nio uses Swift Package Manager all you need to do is clone the project, open it in Xcode and hit <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>R</kbd> to run the app on your simulator or device.

### Why "Nio"?

*Nio* is short for *Niobe* (albeit pronounced differently), captain of the ship *Logos* in the [Matrix trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)). Additionally it's a homonym of *Neo*, because there's definitely not enough Matrix projects jumping on that pun train already.

The abbreviation NIO is also commonly used to refer to the term *non-blocking IO*. I find this entertaining for a messaging client, which is essentially a human IO interface.
