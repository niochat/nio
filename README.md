Nio is an upcoming [Matrix](https://matrix.org) client for iOS.

For the time being this project is still very much a work in progress. For updates, please check by in our matrix room → [#niochat:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#niochat:matrix.org).

Want to give it a spin? Join the public [TestFlight Beta](https://testflight.apple.com/join/KlXr3kKz).

### Getting Started

Since Nio uses Swift Package Manager all you need to do is clone the project, open it in Xcode and hit <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>R</kbd> to run the app on your simulator or device.

### Translations

If you can help translate Nio into other languages your help would be much appreciated! Translation files are available on [translate.riot.im](https://translate.riot.im/engage/nio).

### Funding

As with any project, development costs a lot of time and money. Nio has no intention whatsoever of ever becoming a paid application or to support itself through *icky* means like ads or selling user data. But if you feel so inclined to support the project financially, we'd be forever grateful.

You can either use [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/nio/) for "traditional" payment methods or donate some [Nano](https://nano.org) to `nano_1dr4k1p63sas5qf9wyepqnuxwpjgik8z1f3nmk1gs8dpopaz97er6rq4tojm`.

Other cryptocurrencies are of course just as welcome, just ask in the chat.

Thank you! ❤️

### Why "Nio"?

*Nio* is short for *Niobe* (albeit pronounced differently), captain of the ship *Logos* in the [Matrix trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)). Additionally it's a homonym of *Neo*, because there's definitely not enough Matrix projects jumping on that pun train already.

The abbreviation NIO is also commonly used to refer to the term *non-blocking IO*. I find this entertaining for a messaging client, which is essentially a human IO interface.
